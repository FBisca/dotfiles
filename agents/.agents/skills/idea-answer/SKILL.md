# Idea answer

**Input:** an idea folder (`V/01-projects/<slug>/`, stage `gate1` or `answering`), or a decided feature with sources and no folder yet.
**Output:** `answers.md` entries, updated assumption results, a `gate2` line in `gates.md`, hours logged, and an `idea_check --gate 2` report shown to the user.
**Hand-off:** gate 2 passed means `/to-spec` (writes `PRD.md` in the folder through the vault tracker setup), then `/goldfish <folder>/PRD.md`. Kill or reshape ends here with the reason in `gates.md`.

Agents asked the late questions in the backtest and nobody answered: operators, finance, compliance and leadership did. This skill gets the user to those people with the right questions. It never sends anything.

**Owner guidance** (route by what the question is about):
- finance: business and finance rules, e.g. "what fee must this clear?"; ask the ops owner of that rule; record owner finance
- compliance: legal, security, data access, e.g. "may we store these documents outside the EU?"
- engineering: how the system behaves, e.g. "does the API return the sync date?"; never operators; goes to `/start-planning` Gather
- operator/user: how people react to or use it, e.g. "how do ops handle a failed transfer today?"
- decider: scope and priority, e.g. "is mobile in scope for v1?"
- ethical: could it harm someone, would users object if they knew; compliance, or the decider when it is a product call
- product-behaviour rules (what the product does in a case): the person who owns that behaviour (operator/user if ops runs it, decider if it is a product call); don't default to decider

## Steps

1. **Open the folder.** Read the index note (`<Title>.md`, the one root-level note with `type: project`), `frame.md`, `assumptions.md`, `premortem.md`, `answers.md`, `gates.md` (the contract is the module docstring of `idea-frame/scripts/idea_check.py`). Set `stage: answering`.
   - **Decided feature, no folder:** create `V/01-projects/<slug>/` with the index note built from `~/developer/vault/90-templates/project.md` (`<Title>.md`, titled like the idea; frontmatter `type: project`, `status: idea`, `stage: answering`, `entry: decided`, `decider: <role>`) listing `[[assumptions]] [[answers]] [[gates]]` under `## Notes`, and `assumptions.md` from the sources (each unconfirmed claim: risk, importance, evidence, owner type, test as `<type>: <success criterion>` (interview, prototype, data, survey, spike)). Open questions without an answer are rows too. Side notes carry frontmatter `type: note`, `area`, `project: "[[<Title>]]"`, `created`, `updated`, `tags: []`. Skip frame and pre-mortem; gate 2 skips their checks for `entry: decided`.
2. **List open items:** every `Source: unknown` frame question, every high-importance assumption with an empty result, every open product question. Rank by importance (high first, then by what would kill the idea).
3. **Pick, then route.** Show the open items ranked by importance and ask the user which 3–5 to take to people. Route and prepare only those: one owner type each (operator/user, finance, compliance, decider, engineering), set on the assumption row using the owner guidance above. The rest stay in `assumptions.md` untouched until gate 2.
   - If gate 2 is run, each unpicked high-importance item gets the result `accepted by <decider role>: low priority, not asked`, confirmed by the decider at gate 2 like engineering items.
   - `idea_check --gate 2` fails `people-cap` above 12 people items; the pick stays well below it.
   - Engineering items are not for people: record them as handed to `/start-planning` Gather. Result: `accepted by <decider role>: engineering, to /start-planning Gather`; the decider confirms it at gate 2. They leave this loop.
4. **Prepare each conversation** for the user, one item at a time, from [`prep.md`](prep.md): who (role), 2-4 Mom Test questions, and the answer that kills or changes the idea: the row's criterion is the answer that kills or changes the idea. Usability items: suggest a `/prototype` session instead of asking.
   - Outreach (mail, Slack, Teams) is drafted only after the user's yes for that item, in their voice, and they send it. This skill never sends and holds no outbound tool.
5. **Record each answer** when the user reports it: an `## ` entry in `answers.md` with the user's summary and the lines `Owner: <type> (<role>)` (the type first, so the cap counts it), `Date: YYYY-MM-DD`, `Link: <link>`, `Summary:` (one each). Write no message bodies, no client or investor names (vault rules); the link points to where the source lives. When this creates `answers.md` in an existing folder, add `[[answers]]` to the index note's `## Notes`. Then set the assumption's result: `confirmed`, `killed`, or `accepted by <role>`. idea-check only needs a non-empty result.
   - An answer that kills or reshapes the idea stops the loop: take it to step 6.
6. **Gate 2 with the decider** (D9): every high-importance assumption tested or accepted by the decider, every open question answered or moved to PRD Further Notes with an owner, except items not picked (no entry; the decider confirms their result). A question moved to PRD Further Notes gets its own `answers.md` entry (`Owner: <type> (<role>)`, `Date:`, `Link:`, `Summary: open → PRD Further Notes`) so `/to-spec` picks it up. Ask the decider's call; write one line in `gates.md`: `- <date> gate2: pass by <role>: <reason>` (or `kill: <reason>` / `reshape: <reason>`). Log the hours under `## Hours` in the index note as `- <date> answering <n>h`; set `stage: gate2` on pass, `killed` or `reshaped` otherwise.
7. **Run the gate** and show the output verbatim:

   ```
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/idea-frame/scripts/idea_check.py <folder> --gate 2
   ```

   Fix every FAIL (usually a missing Link, empty result, or decider mismatch), rerun until none. Never edit the check or the decider to pass.
8. **Hand off** by naming `/to-spec`; after `/to-spec` writes `PRD.md`, set `stage: prd`; then name `/goldfish <folder>/PRD.md`. Do not run either.

Done when `idea_check --gate 2` prints no FAIL and the next command is named, or the idea is killed or reshaped with the reason recorded.

## Rules

- Questions in Mom Test form: past behaviour and specifics; never pitch the idea; never hypotheticals.
- Decisions come from the decider or a source. Never fill `answers.md` or a result from your own inference.
- Only the user's yes unlocks a draft; only the user sends.
