# Idea answer

**Input:** an idea folder (`V/01-projects/<slug>/`, stage `gate1` or `answering`), or a decided feature with sources and no folder yet.
**Output:** `answers.md` entries, updated assumption results, a `gate2` line in `gates.md`, hours logged, and an `idea_check --gate 2` report shown to Felippe.
**Hand-off:** gate 2 passed means `/to-spec` (writes `PRD.md` in the folder through the vault tracker setup), then `/goldfish <folder>/PRD.md`. Kill or reshape ends here with the reason in `gates.md`.

Agents asked the late questions in the backtest and nobody answered: operators, finance, compliance and leadership did. This skill gets Felippe to those people with the right questions. It never sends anything.

## Steps

1. **Open the folder.** Read the index note (`<Title>.md`, the one root-level note with `type: project`), `frame.md`, `assumptions.md`, `premortem.md`, `answers.md`, `gates.md` (the contract is the module docstring of `idea-frame/scripts/idea_check.py`). Set `stage: answering`.
   - **Decided feature, no folder:** create `V/01-projects/<slug>/` with the index note (`<Title>.md`, titled like the idea; frontmatter `type: project`, `status: idea`, `stage: answering`, `entry: decided`, `decider: <role>`), and `assumptions.md` from the sources (each unconfirmed claim: risk, importance, evidence, owner type, test). Open questions without an answer are rows too. Skip frame and pre-mortem; gate 2 skips their checks for `entry: decided`.
2. **List open items:** every `Source: unknown` frame question, every high-importance assumption with an empty result, every open product question. Show the list; Felippe may strike items.
3. **Route each item to one owner type:** operator/user, finance, compliance, decider, engineering. Set the owner on its assumption row.
   - Engineering items are not for people: record them as handed to `/start-planning` Gather, in the result line: handed to `/start-planning` Gather. They leave this loop.
4. **Prepare each conversation** for Felippe, one item at a time, from [`prep.md`](prep.md): who (role), 2-4 Mom Test questions, and the answer that kills or changes the idea. Usability items: suggest a `/prototype` session instead of asking.
   - Outreach (mail, Slack, Teams) is drafted only after Felippe's yes for that item, in his voice, and he sends it. This skill never sends and holds no outbound tool.
5. **Record each answer** when Felippe reports it: an `## ` entry in `answers.md` with Felippe's summary, Owner (role), Date, Link. Write no message bodies, no client or investor names (vault rules); the link points to where the source lives. Then set the assumption's result: `confirmed`, `killed`, or `accepted by <role>`. idea-check only needs a non-empty result.
   - An answer that kills or reshapes the idea stops the loop: take it to step 6.
6. **Gate 2 with the decider** (D9): every high-importance assumption tested or accepted by the decider, every open question answered or moved to PRD Open Questions with an owner. Ask the decider's call; write one line in `gates.md`: `- <date> gate2: pass by <role>: <reason>` (or `kill: <reason>` / `reshape: <reason>`). Log the hours under `## Hours` as `- <date> answering <n>h`; set `stage: gate2` on pass, `killed` or `reshaped` otherwise.
7. **Run the gate** and show the output verbatim:

   ```
   python3 ~/.claude/skills/idea-frame/scripts/idea_check.py <folder> --gate 2
   ```

   Fix every FAIL (usually a missing Link, empty result, or decider mismatch), rerun until none. Never edit the check or the decider to pass.
8. **Hand off** by naming `/to-spec`, then `/goldfish <folder>/PRD.md`. Do not run either.

Done when `idea_check --gate 2` prints no FAIL and the next command is named, or the idea is killed or reshaped with the reason recorded.

## Rules

- Questions in Mom Test form: past behaviour and specifics; never pitch the idea; never hypotheticals.
- Decisions come from the decider or a source. Never fill `answers.md` or a result from your own inference.
- Only Felippe's yes unlocks a draft; only Felippe sends.
