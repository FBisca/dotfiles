# Git Config

This is my shared, modular Git configuration, managed with [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/).

It‚Äôs clean, public, and free of personal identity ‚Äî ready to be dropped onto any machine or shared with collaborators.

---

## üßº What This Is

* ‚úÖ **Safe to share**: no name, no email, no GPG keys
* üß† **Curated**: useful aliases, smart defaults, and powerful patterns
* üß© **Modular**: identity and per-project settings handled via `includeIf`

---

## üîê Private Identity with `includeIf`

This config uses Git‚Äôs `[includeIf]` directive to cleanly separate personal or sensitive data.

It includes this block:

```ini
[includeIf "gitdir:~/"]
  path = ~/.config/git/config.local
```

This automatically loads a personal file (`config.local`) when you're in your home directory (or anywhere under it).
You should create `~/.config/git/config.local` with your identity:

```ini
[user]
  name = Your Name
  email = your@email.com
  signingkey = YOURKEYID

[commit]
  gpgsign = true

[gpg]
  program = gpg

[credential]
  helper = /usr/local/bin/git-credential-manager
```

Want different configs for work and personal projects?

```ini
[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/work/"]
  path = ~/.config/git/work.gitconfig

[includeIf "gitdir:~/projects/personal/"]
  path = ~/.config/git/personal.gitconfig
```

This allows Git to auto-switch identities and settings based on the project path.

To test what Git is actually loading:

```bash
git config --show-origin --list
```
